# For this Spotify Analytics project, I downloaded Spotify data file from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table into which I inserted Spotify data.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#I answered the following questions using a combination of SQL queries:

#Who are the top 5 artists by popularity?

SELECT popularity, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

#What is the average popularity rating by Artist in descending order?

SELECT artist_name
, AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) desc;

#What are the top ten fastest songs measured by tempo?

SELECT tempo, track_name, artist_name AS Artist
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo desc
LIMIT 10;

#Which artist has the fastest song measured by tempo?

SELECT tempo, track_name, artist_name AS Artist
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo desc
LIMIT 1;

#List the songs in duration (minutes) from shortest to longest

SELECT (duration_ms/1000)*0.0166667 AS 'Duration in Minutes', track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms asc;

#Which artist released the shortest song?

SELECT (duration_ms/1000)*0.0166667 AS 'Duration in Minutes', track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms asc
LIMIT 1;

#How many songs does Olivia Rodrigo have on the list?

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, count(track_id)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
WHERE artist_name LIKE '%Olivia%';

#What is the avg length in minutes for The Weeknd's songs?

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, AVG(duration_ms/1000)*0.0166667
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name LIKE '%weeknd%';
